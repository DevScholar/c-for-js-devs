# Benchmarking

Running benchmarks in C is done via third party tools.

JavaScript users can make use of `Benchmark.js` library to benchmark methods and track their performance. The equivalent of `Benchmark.js` in C is a tool named `ansibench`.

As per its [documentation][ansibench-docs], `ansibench` collects and stores statistical information from run to run and can automatically detect performance regressions as well as measuring optimizations.
