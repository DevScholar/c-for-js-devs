# Project Structure

The JavaScript standard does not specify a specification for the structure of the project. Generally speaking, all the files in a JavaScript library are usually placed in a folder named after the library. The following is a common JavaScript project specification:

    .
    +-- src/
    |   +-- project1.js
    +-- styles/
    |   +-- style1.js
    +-- examples/
    |   +-- some-example.js
    +-- tests/
        +-- some-integration-test.js

The C standard does not specify a specification for the structure of the project.

## Managing large projects

For very large projects in C, different IDEs and different toolchains have different ways to manage large projects.

## Managing dependency versions

There is no concept of dependency in the C standard, different IDEs and different toolchains have different ways to manage dependency versions.
