# Namespaces

In JavaScript, there is no such thing as a namespace. Instead, JavaScript developers use sub-objects or conventions to implement namespace-like functionality. 

In C, there is no direct support for namespaces like in C++. However, it is possible to achieve a similar effect by using a naming convention to simulate namespaces. One common approach is to prefix your functions and variables with a unique identifier to mimic the behavior of namespaces.
