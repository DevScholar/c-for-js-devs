# Getting Started

## Online C Compilers

The easiest way to get started with C without needing any local installation is to use online C compilers. They are minimal development front-ends that runs in the Web browser and allows writing and running C code.

## Dev Container

The execution environment of the online C compilers has some limitations, such as total compilation/execution time, memory and networking so another option that does not require installing C would be to use a _dev container_. Like online C compilers, the dev container can be run directly in a Web browser using [GitHub Codespaces] or [locally using Visual Studio Code][vscode-dev-containers].

## Local Install

For a complete local installation of C compiler and its development tools, see the installation page on websites of different compilers.
